# DPA-calculation-using-OpenMC
This repository contains an OpenMC code that can be usuful in order to compute DPA in the first wall of a fusion reactor. 

Important considerations: \
the geometry is very simplified, this example has been made only for teaching pourpose. \
Since this code aims to be most open source as possible, some comment lines are present in the preview. In this way, I hope that everyone can be capable to modify and try to look at the differences with other materials. \ 

Best regards,\
Lorenzo
